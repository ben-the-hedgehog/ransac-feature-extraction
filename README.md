# RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Conensus) Geometric Primitive Extraction

This project uses the RANSAC algorithm to extract geometric primitives(lines, circles, and other simple geometric shapes) from images.

To build the project in Visual Studio, have OpenCV installed under `C:\tools`

See the detailed setup instructions at:
